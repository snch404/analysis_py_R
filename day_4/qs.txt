Lab Assignment

1. Open a existing file and count number of lines and no of characters available in the file.

2. Using some Editor, create a text file (name: cities.txt) containing names of 10 cities viz. 
   Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Patna, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Gandhinagar and Srinagar, one in each line. 
   Now take source file name and destination file name from the user. 
   Use exception handling to report "FileNotFoundError", if any, for the source file. 
   Copy the source text file to the destination.

3. Accept two numbers number1 and number2 from user separated by comma, 
   find out division of two numbers by using try - except block. 
   Handle ZeroDivisionError, SyntaxError if inputs are not separated by comma.

4. Create two user defined exceptions as TooHot and TooCold. 
   Write a python program which will accept temperature from user and display entered temperature if 
   it is within range 20 to 40 degrees and throw TooHot if the temperature exceeds 40 degrees and throw 
   TooCold if the temperature is less than 20 degrees.

5. Write a Python program to first take an integer number (x), where 1 <= x <= 255, from the user 
   by using the prompt "Number of registers in the CPU:". 
   Use try-except block to wait indefinitely until the given input is an integer.
   Check the validity of the range of the input in a user defined function "check_range". 
   Now, call a function 'find_n' to find out a positive number (n) such that $2n$ is the least integer 
   greater than or equal to x. Display the value of n with prompt "The number of bits for the Register 
   field in the Instruction format is:"
