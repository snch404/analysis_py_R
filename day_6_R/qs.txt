Lab Assignment: R Programming (CSE3172)
1. Write a R program to create a vector of a specified type and length. Create a vector of numeric,
   complex, logical, and character types of length 6.

2. Accept user input to populate the specific vector.
a. Prepare the following data frame.

ID	Name	Sub1	Sub2	Sub3
1	AAA	56	57	58
2	BBB	78	70	78
3	CCC	90	70	70
4	DDD	65	70	50
5	EEE	90	97	90

b. Add new column Total and Average in the data frame.

c. Add a new column Grade based on the following criteria:

if(average >= 90): grade = 'O'

if(average < 90 and average >= 80): grade = 'A'

if(average < 80 and average >= 70): grade = 'B'

if(average < 70 and average >= 60): grade = 'C'

if(average < 60 and average >= 50): grade = 'D'

else: grade = 'F'

d. Sort the Dataframe based on grade so that you can see the topper at the top.

3. Use "marks_student2.csv". Answer the following questions:
(a) Find out the number of columns and their names. How many students are there?

(b) How many are male students and how many are female students?

(c) Filter out A values from both test marks and reassign 0 in case of A.

(d) How many students scored more than 20 in total, ignore NA?

(e) Compute the percentage of students getting more than 60% considering 25 as the total marks, 
    ignore NA.

4. From the dataframe given in question 2, find out the mean, median, standard deviation, and 
   variance of the marks obtained in each of the subjects and display in a tabular format.

5. Modify the dataframe such that the following marks are missing:

Sub2 for BBB

Sub3 for DDD

Sub1 for EEE

6. What will be the output if the missing values in the dataset are ignored?
